PyGit is not just another Git client; it's a paradigm shift in how you interact with Git within the terminal. Designed for developers who demand power, speed, and customization, PyGit offers a Neovim-inspired TUI built with Python and the Textual library.  Experience a truly immersive and efficient Git workflow that adapts to your needs.

## Unleash the Power of Asynchronous Git

At its core, PyGit is engineered with an asynchronous architecture. This means you can perform complex Git operations, even on massive repositories, without experiencing any blocking or delays. Enjoy a fluid and responsive interface that keeps pace with your workflow.

## Embrace the Efficiency of Modal Editing

Inspired by the modal editing paradigm of Neovim, PyGit empowers you to navigate, stage, commit, and manage your Git repositories with keyboard-driven precision. Seamlessly transition between modes to streamline your workflow and maximize your productivity.

## Extend and Customize to Your Heart's Content

PyGit is built for extensibility.  Develop custom plugins and extensions to tailor PyGit to your exact requirements. Integrate with your favorite tools and services to create a truly personalized development environment that enhances your workflow.

## Visualize Your Git History

Gain deeper insights into your Git repositories with PyGit's interactive visualizations. Explore commit history, branch structures, and diffs with clarity and ease.  Understand the evolution of your codebase and make informed decisions.

## Experience Unmatched Performance

PyGit is meticulously optimized for performance.  Experience lightning-fast Git operations and efficient resource utilization, even with the most demanding projects.  Focus on your code, not on waiting for your Git client to catch up.

## Installation

PyGit is easy to install with pip:

```bash
pip install pygit
